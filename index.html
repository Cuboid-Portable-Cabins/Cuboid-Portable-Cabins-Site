                                are designed to provide restroom facilities in areas where permanent bathrooms are not
                                available or feasible. These cabins are constructed from mild steel and are often
                                modular, allowing them to be easily transported and assembled on-site. They typically
                                include features such as toilets, sinks, and lighting, and can be customized to meet
                                specific needs and requirements. They are commonly used for outdoor events, construction
                                sites, and remote work locations.</p>
