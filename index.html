                                cabins are constructed by joining together prefabricated panels made from materials such
                                as polyurethane, polystyrene, or rockwool, which are sandwiched between two metal
                                sheets. This construction technique makes puff panel cabins lightweight, durable, and
                                easy to assemble. They are also customizable, allowing for a wide range of designs and
